## Project Overview

This comprehensive kitchen renovation transformed a dated 1990s kitchen into a modern, functional space that perfectly suited the client's lifestyle and aesthetic preferences.

## Project Details

- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Budget**: $45,000
- **Location**: Québec City, QC
- **Year Completed**: 2024

## Scope of Work

- Complete demolition and reconstruction
- Custom cabinet installation with soft-close hardware
- Quartz countertop installation
- High-end appliance integration
- Custom tile backsplash with herringbone pattern

## Challenges & Solutions

The original kitchen had poor layout flow and insufficient storage. We addressed these issues by:

- Improving lighting throughout the space

## Results

The client now has a beautiful, functional kitchen that has increased their home's value and their enjoyment of cooking. The modern design perfectly complements their home's architecture while providing all the storage and functionality they requested.
